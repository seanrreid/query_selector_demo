# `querySelector()` Demo

This page dynamically lists all elements on the page and their associated IDs.

The default `document.querySelector()` is proxied so classes can be added as the elements are selected.
Clicking one of the control buttons will toggle `document.querSelector()` for that element. Styles will be applied to show which element has been selected.
